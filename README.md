# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Each day has:

* A binary in `src/bin/`
* Example input in `data/example/`
* Input for 'challenges' (needed to progress) in `data/challenge/`

All examples are used as tests. They can be run via `cargo test` or
[`cargo nextest run`](https://nexte.st/).
